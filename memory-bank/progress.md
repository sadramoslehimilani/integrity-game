## Recent Updates

### Game Reset Functionality (September 12, 2025)

**Issue**: When clicking "Play Again" in EndScene, the game would not properly reset, causing state persistence issues.

**Solution**:
1. Fixed scene transition flow in EndScene.js to properly reset the game
2. Updated EndScene.playAgain() to stop all game scenes and start IntroScene with reset data
3. Enhanced IntroScene to handle reset parameter in init() and startGame() methods
4. Updated GameScene and QuizScene to always reset their state upon initialization
5. Added comprehensive logging for debugging scene transitions

**Implementation Details**:
- EndScene.playAgain() now stops all game scenes and starts IntroScene with reset data
- IntroScene handles reset parameter in init() and startGame() methods
- GameScene and QuizScene always reset their state upon initialization
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging scene transitions

### Known Issues

- **Audio System**: Not yet implemented
- **Particle Effects**: Basic framework only, needs enhancement
- **Asset Quality**: Using placeholder assets until final art is created

## Next Steps

1. **Audio Implementation**: Add sound effects and background music
2. **Asset Enhancement**: Replace placeholder assets with custom graphics
3. **Particle Effects**: Implement visual effects for enhanced engagement
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune loading times and animations

## Project Evolution

### Original Concept to Current Implementation

- **Initial Concept**: Simple "Lost Whistle" scenario with basic choices
- **Current State**: Complete "Out of Bounds" scenario with full quiz system, character animations, and proper game reset functionality

### Key Design Decisions

- **Scene Architecture**: Modular scene design with BaseScene inheritance
- **Character System**: Spritesheet-based animations with consistent positioning
- **Quiz Framework**: Flexible question system with integrity scoring
- **Reset Mechanism**: Proper scene management with reset flags and timestamps

### Lessons Learned

- **Phaser Scene Management**: Understanding the nuances of scene transitions and state management
- **Data Persistence**: Careful handling of data between scene transitions
- **Reset Functionality**: Importance of proper scene stopping and starting for clean resets
- **Logging**: Value of comprehensive logging for debugging complex interactions
