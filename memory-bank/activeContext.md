# Active Context: Integrity - The Lost Whistle

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Focus: Memory Bank Establishment

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Created comprehensive memory bank structure
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Established project foundation with core documentation
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Preparing for initial project setup and development environment

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Project Structure Setup**: Create basic Phaser.js project skeleton
2. **Development Environment**: Configure webpack, npm scripts, and local server
3. **Core Scene Framework**: Implement base scene classes and navigation
4. **Asset Pipeline**: Set up asset loading and management system

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Architecture Decisions

- **Phaser.js Version**: Using v3.60+ for stability and modern features
- **Build Tool**: Webpack for module bundling and asset optimization
- **Code Organization**: Scene-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Asset Strategy**: Progressive loading to optimize initial load times

### Design Philosophy

- **Educational First**: Game mechanics serve the learning objectives
- **Age-Appropriate**: Simple, intuitive interactions for 6-9 year olds
- **Inclusive Design**: Touch-friendly controls with keyboard accessibility
- **Performance Conscious**: Optimized for web delivery across devices

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style Preferences

- **ES6+ Features**: Classes, arrow functions, async/await, destructuring
- **Modular Structure**: Separate concerns with clear file organization
- **Consistent Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for public methods and complex logic

### Animation & Interaction Patterns

- **Smooth Transitions**: 300-500ms tweens for UI elements
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to user interactions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce complexity gradually
- **Error Prevention**: Guide users toward correct interactions

### Asset Management Preferences

- **Spritesheet Priority**: Efficient animation delivery
- **Audio Optimization**: Multiple formats for browser compatibility
- **Responsive Images**: Scale appropriately for different screen sizes
- **Loading Strategy**: Preload critical assets, lazy-load optional content

## Current Development Environment

### Local Setup Status

- **Directory Structure**: ‚úÖ Memory bank created
- **Package Configuration**: ‚è≥ Pending npm init
- **Build Configuration**: ‚è≥ Pending webpack setup
- **Development Server**: ‚è≥ Pending configuration

### Tool Preferences

- **Editor**: VS Code with Phaser.js extensions
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commit messages
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, manual testing for game feel
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based memory bank system

## Key Insights & Learnings

### Project Understanding

- **Educational Value**: Game must balance entertainment with clear moral lessons
- **Age Demographics**: 6-9 year olds need simple, engaging, fast-paced experiences
- **Platform Constraints**: Web delivery requires careful performance optimization
- **Accessibility**: Touch controls must work seamlessly across devices

### Technical Considerations

- **Phaser.js Strengths**: Excellent for 2D games, good documentation, active community
- **Web Limitations**: Canvas performance varies by device and browser
- **Asset Loading**: Critical for user experience - slow loads lose young players
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch events, battery life, and screen size variations

## Active Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Balancing Education & Entertainment

**Current Approach**: Story-driven gameplay with immediate feedback and positive reinforcement

### Challenge: Cross-Device Compatibility

**Current Approach**: Responsive design with touch-first interactions and progressive enhancement

### Challenge: Asset Creation Pipeline

**Current Approach**: AI-generated assets with manual optimization for web delivery

## Next Development Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- Set up project structure and development environment
- Create basic scene framework and navigation
- Implement core game loop and input handling

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay

- Build character system and animations
- Implement decision mechanics and branching logic
- Create quiz system with feedback

### Phase 3: Polish & Assets

- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement particle effects and visual polish
- Optimize performance and loading times

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment

- Cross-browser and device testing
- User experience validation with target age group
- Deployment and hosting setup

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Browser Compatibility**: Regular testing across target browsers
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor frame rates and memory usage
- **Asset Loading**: Implement fallbacks and loading states

### Project Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Stick to core educational objectives
- **Timeline Delays**: Break development into manageable phases
- **Quality Issues**: Regular playtesting and iteration

## Communication & Collaboration Notes

### Documentation Standards

- **Memory Bank Updates**: Update relevant files after each development session
- **Code Comments**: Document complex logic and architectural decisions
- **Commit Messages**: Clear, descriptive messages following conventional format

### Quality Assurance

- **Regular Testing**: Test each feature as it's implemented
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track loading times and frame rates
- **User Feedback**: Validate with target age group when possible

## Current State Summary

**Status**: Project initialization complete, ready for active development
**Focus**: Establishing solid foundation before building core features
**Confidence**: High - clear requirements, proven technology stack, structured approach
**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 development with project structure setup
