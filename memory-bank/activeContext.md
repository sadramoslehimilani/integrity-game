- ðŸ”„ **CURRENT**: Ready for Phase 4 - Assets & Polish Enhancement

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Audio Implementation**: Add sound effects and background music
2. **Asset Enhancement**: Replace placeholder assets with custom graphics
3. **Particle Effects**: Implement visual effects for enhanced engagement
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune loading times and animations

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Architecture Decisions

- **Phaser.js Version**: Using v3.60+ for stability and modern features
- **Build Tool**: Webpack for module bundling and asset optimization
- **Code Organization**: Scene-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Asset Strategy**: Progressive loading to optimize initial load times
- **Scene Transitions**: Improved scene management with proper reset handling

### Design Philosophy

- **Educational First**: Game mechanics serve the learning objectives
- **Age-Appropriate**: Simple, intuitive interactions for 6-9 year olds
- **Inclusive Design**: Touch-friendly controls with keyboard accessibility
- **Performance Conscious**: Optimized for web delivery across devices

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style Preferences

- **ES6+ Features**: Classes, arrow functions, async/await, destructuring
- **Modular Structure**: Separate concerns with clear file organization
- **Consistent Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for public methods and complex logic
- **Logging**: Extensive console logging for debugging scene transitions

### Animation & Interaction Patterns

- **Smooth Transitions**: 300-500ms tweens for UI elements
- **Character Animations**: Spritesheet-based animations
  - Coach Leo: 4 frames at 4fps
  - Nico: 12 frames at 12fps with 10px spacing
  - Carla: 9 frames at 9fps with 10px spacing
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to user interactions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce complexity gradually
- **Error Prevention**: Guide users toward correct interactions
- **Animation Positioning**: Characters positioned above dialogue boxes with proper depth layering

### Asset Management Preferences

- **Spritesheet Priority**: Efficient animation delivery
- **Audio Optimization**: Multiple formats for browser compatibility
- **Responsive Images**: Scale appropriately for different screen sizes
- **Loading Strategy**: Preload critical assets, lazy-load optional content

### Scene Management Patterns

- **Scene Transitions**: Using scene.start() for complete scene resets
- **Data Passing**: Structured data objects passed between scenes
- **Reset Handling**: Explicit reset flags and timestamps for tracking game restarts
- **State Initialization**: Each scene properly initializes its state in init() method
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging scene transitions

##### Current Development Environment

### Local Setup Status

- **Directory Structure**: âœ… Complete with src/scenes/, assets/, memory-bank/
- **Package Configuration**: âœ… Phaser.js integrated and functional
- **Build Configuration**: âœ… Python HTTP server running on localhost:8000
- **Development Server**: âœ… Fully operational with live preview

### Tool Preferences

- **Editor**: VS Code with Phaser.js extensions
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commit messages
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, manual testing for game feel
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based memory bank system

## Key Insights & Learnings

### Project Understanding

- **Educational Value**: Game must balance entertainment with clear moral lessons
- **Age Demographics**: 6-9 year olds need simple, engaging, fast-paced experiences
- **Platform Constraints**: Web delivery requires careful performance optimization
- **Accessibility**: Touch controls must work seamlessly across devices

### Technical Considerations

- **Phaser.js Strengths**: Excellent for 2D games, good documentation, active community
- **Web Limitations**: Canvas performance varies by device and browser
- **Asset Loading**: Critical for user experience - slow loads lose young players
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch events, battery life, and screen size variations
- **Scene Management**: Proper scene transitions require careful state management

## Active Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Game Reset Functionality

**Problem**: When clicking "Play Again" in EndScene, the game would not properly reset, causing state persistence issues.

**Solution**: 
1. Implemented proper scene stopping and starting in EndScene.playAgain()
2. Added reset flag and timestamp to track game restarts
3. Updated all scenes to properly handle reset data
4. Enhanced logging for debugging scene transitions
5. Ensured each scene properly initializes its state in init() method

**Implementation Details**:
- EndScene.playAgain() now stops all game scenes and starts IntroScene with reset data
- IntroScene handles reset parameter in init() and startGame() methods
- GameScene and QuizScene always reset their state upon initialization
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging scene transitions

### Challenge: State Persistence Between Scenes

**Problem**: Game state (score, choices) needed to be properly passed between scenes.

**Solution**:
1. Structured data objects passed between scenes
2. Each scene properly initializes from received data
3. Clear separation between normal initialization and reset initialization

**Implementation Details**:
- GameScene passes gameData to QuizScene
- QuizScene calculates final score and passes to EndScene
- EndScene provides reset data when restarting the game
- All scenes properly handle both normal and reset initialization
